# {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} integration
{: #auditing_events-for-cloudant}

Users of {{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}} can use {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full}}, a platform service, to route auditing events in your account to destinations of your choice by configuring targets and routes that define where activity tracking events are sent. {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}. You can use this platform service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. You can also be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. For more information, see [Auditing events](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-at_events).
