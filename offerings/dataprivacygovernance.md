To govern the movement of data from the EU to the US,
{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} complied with both US-EU and US-Swiss
[Safe Harbour Frameworks](https://www.export.gov/safeharbor_eu){: new_window}{: external}.
The European Court of Justice
[invalidated](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=169195&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=113326){: new_window}{: external}
the Safe Harbour agreement in 2015. 
{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} was quick to urge policymakers to work expediently
to ensure "[unbroken data flows between the European Union and the United States](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_16_216){: new_window}{: external}".

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} prepared an EU Model Clauses agreement for {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} customers
to facilitate the transfer of personal data outside the EU
in accordance with the EU data privacy laws.
EU Model clauses are relevant to all customers
that send personal information about EU citizens to {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}.

To request an EU Model Clauses agreement,
or for any other information or assistance around the transfer of personal data,
customers can email the dedicated EU Model Clauses team at eu-mc@ie.ibm.com.

The EU Directive 95/46/EC sets out rules about the processing of customer's personal data.
As the data controller,
customers appoint {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} as a data processor to process any personal data that might be included in the customer's content.
In turn,
customers are responsible for obtaining all necessary consents
to include the content (including any personal data) in the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} solutions.

A list of countries where content might be held,
or from where content might be accessed,
for delivering and supporting a Cloud Service,
is available at [www.ibm.com/cloud/datacenters](http://www.ibm.com/cloud/datacenters){: new_window}{: external}.
