# Creating a Cloudant instance on Bluemix using the Cloud Foundry tools

This tutorial shows you how to create an {{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}}
service instance on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
using the Cloud Foundry tools.
{:shortdesc}

## Pre-requisites

To follow this tutorial,
you must first install the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Cloud Foundry tools.
Details for installing the tools are available in
[this separate tutorial](create_bmxapp_appenv.html#the-cloud-foundry-and-bluemix-command-toolkits).

> **Note**: Ensure you install both the Cloud Foundry _and_
  the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} toolkits.

## Identifying the Bluemix API endpoint

Specify the target API endpoint for your Cloud Foundry commands;

```sh
bx api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
```
{:codeblock}

The result confirms that you have correctly identified the endpoint:

```sh
Setting api endpoint to https://api.ng.bluemix.net...
OK

API endpoint: https://api.ng.bluemix.net (API version: 2.54.0)
Not logged in. Use 'bx login' to log in.
```
{:pre}

## Logging in to your Bluemix account

1.  Use the following command to start the login process for
  your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account:
  
  ```sh
  bx login
  ```
  {:codeblock}
  
  {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} replies by reminding you of the current
  API endpoint,
  then asks for the email address of your account:
  
  ```sh
  API endpoint: https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  
  Email>
  ```
  {:pre}

2.  Enter the email address of your account.
  {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} then asks for the password for your account:
  ```sh
  API endpoint: https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  
  Email> J.Doe@email.com
  
  Password>
  ```
  {:pre}
  
  {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} validates your details,
  then summarizes the information about your login session:
  ```sh
  API endpoint: https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  
  Email> J.Doe@email.com
  
  Password> 
  Authenticating...
  OK
  
  Targeted account J DOE's Account (707...a32)
  
  Targeted org J.Doe@email.com
  
  Targeted space dev
  
  API endpoint:   https://api.ng.bluemix.net (API version: 2.54.0)
  Region:         us-south
  User:           j.doe@email.com
  Account:        J DOE's Account (707...a32)
  Org:            J.Doe@email.com
  Space:          dev
  ```
  {:pre}

3.  You have now logged in to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account.

## Choosing the Cloudant plan for your service

Obtain a list of all the available service offerings.
Filter the list to match only {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} services:

```sh
bx service offerings | grep -i Cloudant
```
{:codeblock}

The result is a list of the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} services
available to your account,
including the specific plans you can select:

```sh
cloudantNoSQLDB   Lite, Standard*
```
{:pre}

**Optional**: To see more details about the plans,
use the following command:

```sh
bx cf marketplace -s cloudantNoSQLDB
```
{:codeblock}

The result is a summary of the available plans,
similar to the following section of an example response (details correct as at May 2017):

```
Lite
The Lite plan provides access to the full functionality of Cloudant for development and evaluation.
The plan has a set amount of provisioned throughput capacity as shown
and includes a max of 1GB of encrypted data storage.   free
```
{:pre}

## Creating the Cloudant service

The basic command format to create a service instance
within {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is as follows:

```sh
bx service create <service> <plan> <instance name>
```
{:pre}

Assume we want to create an instance of
a {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service using the `Lite` plan,
where the instance name is `cs20170517a`.

Do this by using a command similar to the following example:

```sh
bx service create cloudantNoSQLDB Lite cs20170517a
```
{:codeblock}

After creating the service instance,
responds with a message similar to the following example:

```sh
Invoking 'cf create-service cloudantNoSQLDB Lite cs20170517a'...

Creating service instance cs20170517a in org J.Doe@email.com / space dev as J.Doe@email.com...
OK

```
{:pre}

## Creating credentials for your Cloudant service

Applications that require access to your {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service
must have the necessary credentials.

>   **Note**: Service credentials are valuable.
    If anyone or any application has access to the credentials,
    they can effectively do whatever they want with the service instance,
    for example they might create spurious data,
    or delete valuable information.
    Protect these credentials carefully.

The service credentials consist of five fields:

Field      | Purpose
-----------|--------
`host`     | The host name that is used by applications to locate the service instance.
`username` | The user name that is required for applications to access the service instance.
`password` | The password that is required for applications to access the service instance.
`port`     | The HTTP port number for accessing the service instance on the host. Normally 443 to force HTTPS access.
`url`      | A string aggregating the other credential information into a single URL, suitable for use by applications.

The basic command format to create credentials for a service instance
within {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is as follows:

```sh
bx cf create-service-key <instance name> <credentials name>
```
{:pre}

Assume we want to create credentials for the `cs20170517a` instance of
a {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service,
where the name for the credentials is `creds20170517a`.

Do this by using a command similar to the following example:

```sh
bx cf create-service-key cs20170517a creds20170517a
```
{:codeblock}

After receiving the request to create credentials for the service instance,
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} responds with a message similar to the following example:

```sh
Invoking 'cf create-service-key cs20170517a creds20170517a'...

Creating service key creds20170517a for service instance cs20170517a as J.Doe@email.com...
OK
```
{:pre}

## Listing the service credentials for your Cloudant service

The basic command format to retrieve the credentials for a service instance
within {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is as follows:

```sh
bx cf service-key <instance name> <credentials name>
```
{:pre}

Assume we want to retrieve credentials for the `cs20170517a` instance of
a {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service,
where the name for the credentials is `creds20170517a`.

Do this by using a command similar to the following example:

```sh
bx cf service-key cs20170517a creds20170517a
```
{:codeblock}

After receiving the request to retrieve the credentials for the service instance,
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} responds with a message similar to the following (abbreviated) example:

```sh
Invoking 'cf service-key cs20170517a creds20170517a'...

Getting key creds20170517a for service instance cs20170517a as J.Doe@email.com...

{
 "host": "946...46f-bluemix.cloudant.com",
 "password": "4eb...eb5",
 "port": 443,
 "url": "https://946...46f-bluemix:4eb...eb5@946...46f-bluemix.cloudant.com",
 "username": "946...46f-bluemix"
}
```
{:pre}

## Using your Cloudant service instance

At this point,
you have:

1.  Created a {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service
  instance within {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
2.  Created credentials for the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service instance.
3.  Retrieved the service instance credentials, so that they can be used by your application.

A tutorial showing how to use a {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service instance
is available [here](create_database.html#context).
Remember to substitute the credentials you created in this tutorial.

## (Optional) Tidying up afterwards

The following short list of commands might be helpful in tidying up your development environment.

### Deleting service credentials

To delete a set of service credentials,
use a command similar to the following:

```sh
bx cf delete-service-key <instance name> <credentials name>
```
{:pre}

For example,
to delete the credentials called `creds20170517a`
from the `cs20170517a` instance of
a {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service,
you might use a command like this:

```sh
bx cf delete-service-key cs20170517a creds20170517a
```
{:pre}

### Deleting a service instance

To delete a service instance,
use a command similar to the following:

```sh
bx service delete <instance name>
```
{:pre}

For example,
to delete the `cs20170517a` instance of
a {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service,
you might use a command like this:

```sh
bx service delete cs20170517a
```
{:pre}
