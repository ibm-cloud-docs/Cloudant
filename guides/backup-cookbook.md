# Cloudant backup and recovery

This cookbook forms part of the [{{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}} Disaster Recovery guide](disaster-recovery-and-backup.html).
It's worth starting there if you are new to the subject and want to understand where backup fits in
with the other capabilities that {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} offers
to support Disaster Recovery (DR) and High Availability (HA) requirements.

Although data is stored redundantly within a {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} cluster,
it's important to consider extra backup measures.
For example,
redundant data storage does not protect against mistakes when data is changed.

## Introducing CouchBackup

{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} provides a supported tool for snapshot backup and restore.
The tool is called CouchBackup,
and is open source.
It is a `node.js` library,
and is [available to install on npm ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")][npmpackage]{:new_window}.

In addition to the library,
the CouchBackup package contains two command line tools:

1. `couchbackup`, which dumps the JSON data from a database to a backup text file.
2. `couchrestore`, which restores data from a backup text file to a database.

<strong style="color:red;">Warning!</strong> The CouchBackup tools have [limitations](#limitations).

## Backing up your Cloudant data

You can do a simple backup by using the `couchbackup` tool.
To back up the `animaldb` database to a text file called `backup.txt`,
you might use a command similar to the following example:

```sh
couchbackup --url https://examples.cloudant.com --db animaldb > backup.txt
```
{:codeblock}

The [npm readme ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")][npmreadme]{:new_window} details other options,
including:

* Environment variables to set the names of the database and URL.
* Using a log file to record the progress of a backup.
* The ability to resume an interrupted backup.
  **Note**: This option is only available with the log file for the interrupted backup.
* Sending the backup text file to a named output file,
  rather than redirecting the `stdout` output.

<strong style="color:red;">Warning!</strong> The CouchBackup tools have [limitations](#limitations).

## Restoring your Cloudant data

To restore your data,
use the `couchrestore` tool.
Use `couchrestore` to import the backup file
into a new {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} database.
Then,
ensure that you build all indexes before any application attempts to use the restored data.

For example,
to restore the data that was backed up in the earlier example:

```sh
couchrestore --url https://myaccount.cloudant.com --db newanimaldb < backup.txt
```
{:codeblock}

The [npm readme ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")][npmreadme]{:new_window} provides details of other restore options.

<strong style="color:red;">Warning!</strong> The CouchBackup tools have [limitations](#limitations).

## Limitations

<strong style="color:red;">Warning!</strong> The CouchBackup tools have the following limitations: 

* `_security` settings are not backed up by the tools.
* Attachments are not backed up by the tools.
* Backups are not precisely accurate "point-in-time" snapshots.
  The reason is that the documents in the database are retrieved in batches,
  but other applications might be updating documents at the same time.
  Therefore,
  the data in the database can change between the times when the first and last batches are read.
* Index definitions that are held in design documents are backed up,
  but the content of indexes is not backed up.
  This limitation means that when data is restored,
  the indexes must be rebuilt.
  The rebuilding might take a considerable amount of time,
  depending on how much data is restored.

## Using the tools

The [npm page ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")][npmpackage]{:new_window}
details the basics of using the command line tools for backup and restore of data.
The following examples show how to put those details into practice
by describing the use of the tools for specific tasks.

The CouchBackup package provides two ways of using its core functions.

* The command line tools can be embedded into standard UNIX command pipelines.
  For many scenarios,
  a combination of `cron` and simple shell scripting of the `couchbackup` application is sufficient.
* A library usable from node.js.
  The library allows more complicated backup processes to be created and deployed,
  such as determining dynamically which databases must be backed up.

Use either the command line backup tool,
or the library with application code,
to enable backup from {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} databases as part of more complicated situations.
A useful scenario is scheduling backups by using `cron`,
and automatically uploading data to
[Cloud Object Storage ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/object-storage-public){:new_window}
for long-term retention.

## Command line scripting examples

Two requirements are frequently encountered:

* Saving disk space,
  by ['zipping' the backup](#zipping-a-backup-file) file as it is created.
* Creating a backup of a database automatically, [at regular intervals](#hourly-or-daily-backups-using-cron).

### Compressing a backup file

The `couchbackup` tool can write a backup file to disk directly,
or stream the backup to `stdout`.
Streaming to `stdout` enables data to be transformed before it is written to disk.
This capability is used to compress data within the stream.

```sh
couchbackup --url "https://examples.cloudant.com" \
  --db "animaldb" | gzip > backup.gz
```
{:codeblock}

In this example,
the `gzip` tool accepts the backup data directly through its `stdin`,
compresses the data,
and emits it through `stdout`.
The resulting compressed data stream is then redirected and written to a file called `backup.gz`.

If the database requires you to supply access credentials,
use a URL of the form `https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com`,
for example:

```sh
couchbackup --url "https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@examples.cloudant.com" \
  --db "animaldb" | gzip > backup.gz
```
{:codeblock}

It is straightforward to extend the pipeline if you want to transform the data in other ways.
For example,
you might want to encrypt the data before it is written to disk.
Alternatively,
you might want to write the data directly to an object store service,
by using their command line tools.

### Hourly or daily backups that use `cron`

The `cron` scheduling tool can be set up to take snapshots of data at regular intervals

A useful starting point is to get `couchbackup` to write a single backup to a file,
where the file name includes the current date and time,
as shown in the following example:

```sh
couchbackup --url "https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com" \
  --db "animaldb" > animaldb-backup-`date -u "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`.bak
```
{:codeblock}

After you check the command to ensure it works correctly,
it can be entered into a 'cron job':

1.  Install the CouchBackup tools on the server that you want to do the backups.
2.  Create a folder to store the backups.
3.  Create a 'cron entry' that describes the frequency of the backup.

You can create a cron entry by using the `crontab -e` command.
Consult your system documentation for specific details on the 'cron' options.

A cron entry to do a daily backup is similar to the following example:

```sh
0 5 * * * couchbackup --url "https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com" --db "animaldb" > /path/to/folder/animaldb-backup-`date -u "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`.bak
```
{:codeblock}

This cron entry creates a daily backup at 05:00.
You can modify the cron pattern to do hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly backups as needed.

## Using CouchBackup as a library

The `couchbackup` and `couchrestore` command line tools are wrappers around a library
that can be used in your own node.js applications.

The library is useful for more complicated scenarios,
for example:

* Backing up several databases in one task.
  You might do this backup by identifying all the databases by using the [`_all_dbs`](../api/database.html#get-databases) call,
  then doing a backup of each database individually.
* Longer pipelines increase the risk of errors.
  By using the CouchBackup library,
  your application can detect and address any error at the earliest opportunity.

For more information,
see the [npm page ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")][npmpackage]{:new_window}.

The following script sample shows how to combine the `couchbackup` library
with use of {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} Cloud Object Storage.
This code illustrates how you might use Cross Region S3 API to back up a database to an object store.

> **Note**: A prerequisite for the code is that you initialize the S3 client object for
  {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Cloud Object Storage by following
[these instructions ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")][cosclient]{:new_window}.

```javascript
/*
  Backup directly from Cloudant to an S3 bucket via a stream.
  @param {string} couchHost - URL of database root
  @param {string} couchDatabase - backup source database
  @param {object} s3Client - S3 client object
  @param {string} s3Bucket - Destination S3 bucket (must exist)
  @param {string} s3Key - Destination object's key (shouldn't exist)
  @param {boolean} shallow - Whether to use couchbackup's shallow mode
  @returns {Promise}
*/
function backupToS3(sourceUrl, s3Client, s3Bucket, s3Key, shallow) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    debug('Setting up S3 upload to ${s3Bucket}/${s3Key}');

    // A pass through stream that has couchbackup's output
    // written to it and it then read by the S3 upload client.
    // It has a 10MB internal buffer.
    const streamToUpload = new stream.PassThrough({highWaterMark: 10485760});

    // Set up S3 upload.
    const params = {
      Bucket: s3Bucket,
      Key: s3Key,
      Body: streamToUpload
    };
    s3Client.upload(params, function(err, data) {
      debug('S3 upload done');
      if (err) {
        debug(err);
        reject(new Error('S3 upload failed'));
        return;
      }
      debug('S3 upload succeeded');
      debug(data);
      resolve();
    }).httpUploadProgress = (progress) => {
      debug('S3 upload progress: ${progress}');
    };

    debug('Starting streaming data from ${sourceUrl}');
    couchbackup.backup(
      sourceUrl,
      streamToUpload,
      (err, obj) => {
        if (err) {
          debug(err);
          reject(new Error('CouchBackup failed with an error'));
          return;
        }
        debug('Download from ${sourceUrl} complete.');
        streamToUpload.end();  // must call end() to complete S3 upload.
        // resolve() is called by the S3 upload
      }
    );
  });
}
```
